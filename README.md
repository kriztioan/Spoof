# Spoof

`Spoof` is a simple MacOS status bar application for spoofing a `MAC` address. It relies on a privileged helper to set the `MAC` address of the primary interface with `ifconfig`. `Spoof` is written using `Objective-C`.

## Usage

Building `Spoof` requires `Xcode` and can be build using the GUI or from the command line with:

```shell
xcodebuild -scheme SpoofHelperTool build
xcodebuild -scheme Spoof build 
```

For the latter, the `Spoof` application is found in the `build/Release` folder as `Spoof.app`.

Double-clicking `Spoof.app` starts the application, which will present itself as a status bar item. The status bar item
uses the [Stratego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratego) spy character as an icon when spoofing is active, otherwise the [Stratego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratego) marshal character is used. Clicking the status bar icon will open a menu that lists as its first item the primary interface with its currently assigned `MAC` address.

## Configuration

 Spoofing is enabled/disabled by toggling the `Spoof` switch. The `MAC` address used for spoofing can be configured by clicking the `Settings` menu item, which will open a panel where an address can be entered.

## Notes

1. Application `Signing` could require updating from within `Xcode` as no public certificate is provided for `Spoof`. The `Team` and `Signing Certificate` can be set to a `Personal Team` and `Development`, respectively, to run locally. The `Info.plist` files might also require updating, notably the keys `Tools owned after installation` and `Clients allowed to add and remove tool`.
2. Because `Spoof` requires elevated privileges to change the `MAC` address using `ifconfig`, it needs a privileged helper tool to function. It might ask to install it upon first launch, which can require providing an administrator's username/password.
